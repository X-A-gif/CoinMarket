BlockChainBroker

## Description

BlockChainBroker is a website that shows the top 20 cryptocurrencies at any given time. It is a dynamic website that updates in real time. When any one of the top twenty names of the cryptocurrencies is clicked, you are navigated to a new page that shows the name, price, marketcap and supply at the top of the page. You are also shown a chart that gives the past 7 days of coins activities. If you click on a star next to any of the names, it saves your choice to your watchlist. Click the watchlist at the top right of the page and you will navigate to a new page that shows all of your favorite coins you want to watch in one page.
